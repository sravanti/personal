You may notice that none of my previous posts have any images. At all. This is entirely due to my procrastinating renewing my shared server space. I ended up shifting my content last-minute to using a combination of Hugo and Netlify, which was painless and free! The downside is that I don't think my Wordpress export included images, and I lost access to my shared server space, so my image links are broken. :( Sorry about that! I'll work to include them back, particularly for my data-heavy posts (MoMA and Hillary's Inbox). Until
then, bear with me!
