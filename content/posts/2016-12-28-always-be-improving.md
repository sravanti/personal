<p class="p1">
  I recently saw a <a href="https://github.com/ggomaeng/better-developer-quotes">project on Github</a>Â which was a collection of short interviews where people shared how to become a better developer. I really enjoyed reading through advice that developers had to share.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I also noticed there weren&#8217;t any female responses.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So going into 2017, I thought itâ€™d be usefulÂ to run a similar project with my network! I know Â there are awesome womenÂ who have great advice to share with the world about improving yourself technically and wanted to provide a platform for that advice.Â <span class="s1">&#x1f60a;</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  If youâ€™re interested in contributing your thoughts on how to become a better developer, let me know â€”Â ideally, Iâ€™d like to feature a range of experiences from newbie to seasoned developers.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Topics that I think would be useful toÂ center the project around:
</p>

<li class="p1">
  Whatâ€™s something you do to become a better developer? Are there daily / weekly / regular habits you have (e.g. watching an egghead series each week)? <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Sub-topic: what are resources you find helpful to keep your skills sharp?
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Whatâ€™s a soft skill you think is important to become better at what you do?
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Do you do something outside of work that you think makes you better at your day job?
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Whatâ€™s a piece of career advice you wish you could give your younger self?
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Â If you could take a few days off and learn one new technology, what would it be?
</li>

<p class="p1">
  Iâ€™d love to curate responses by early January to provide some inspiration going into 2017 <span class="s1">&#x1f680;</span>Â . Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to add to it over time so that itâ€™s a living document, too (I&#8217;ll probably keep the interviews in a Github repo, just like the other project)! If you or anyone you know is interested, email me at <span class="s2"><a href="mailto:sravanti150@gmail.com">sravanti150@gmail.com</a>Â or DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sravanti__">Twitter</a>.</span>
