This weekend, I revived my journalism chops from my time at The Wellesley News when I, with my partner, reported on an event and &#8220;filed&#8221; a story within four hours as a challenge for my Future of News course.

My internal monologue at the beginning of this assignment: Four hours? _Please. _ I did this all the time at The News, covering events last minute and rushing to get copy in a couple hours later for the copy editors. What I&#8217;d done before could be done again, right?

Well, not exactly. Wendi, my partner, is a print journalist, and so both of us decided to go outside our comfort zone and report using video.

For our assignment, we chose to cover the Chinese Progressive Association&#8217;s Against Gentrification Paint-In event, which is a community response against gentrification in Boston&#8217;s Chinatown neighborhood. In addition to luxury housing displacing longtime residents, we also learned that Chinatown hasn&#8217;t had steady access to a public library since 1952, which was heartbreaking to hear.

We interviewed a few of the people at the event and put together a short video using iMovie (is it clear that neither of us are video producers?). Four hours to go to an event _and _ sift through footage _and _ edit wasn&#8217;t adequate, but I suppose that was the point, wasn&#8217;t it?

Here&#8217;s the video, with my note that I wish I had just a few more minutes to edit the audio!
