Here are the slides from my talk at Write/Speak/Code, Looking for Artists Who Look Like Me: Analyzing the MoMA GitHub repository! Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter with feedback and questions @sravanti__.

And if you do something with the data set or other art museum data sets, let me know! I&#8217;d love to hear about it. My analysis code and ethnicity database can be found atÂ <https://github.com/sravanti/moma-analysis>.
