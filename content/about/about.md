Hi, I&#8217;m Sravanti. &#x1f44b;&#x1f3fd;

This is where I write about what interests me, technical and non-technical. Right now, I&#8217;m [fascinated with cities and urbanism]({{< relref "urbanism.md" >}}) and how we build thriving streets. My interest began during my time as a research assistant at MIT Media Lab&#8217;s City Science group (neé Changing Places) studying ride sharing transportation in developing countries. After living in a couple of cities — namely, Boston and NYC — I now work at Uber as a software engineer in San Francisco making people and cities safer around the world.

My interests outside of programming and urbanism include classical music, baking, lifting weights, volunteering at [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/), and civic hacking.
